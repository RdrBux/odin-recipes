        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a meal on a bun. My Mother used to make this for us when time was limited or when meat wasn't allowed. You can serve it alone with rice and vegetables or on a bun with tomato and lettuce. Delicious and filling</p>        
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (7 ounce) pouch tuna in water, drained and juice reserved</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped celery with leaves</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>Â¼ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2 slices day-old bread, cubed</li>
                <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>

            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix drained tuna, onion, celery, egg, bread crumbs, bread cubes, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. If mixture is too dry to hold together, stir in reserved tuna juice, 1 teaspoon at a time. Divide mixture in fourths and shape each portion into a patty.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and pan-fry the patties until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain patties on paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
